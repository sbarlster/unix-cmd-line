# Unix Command Line Toolbox
The steps below will take you from novice to getting a basic knowledge of the Unix OS and it's command line.

Even after 20+ years of using Unix I find this small set of commands the core of what I need. Yes more is possible and there is, much much more. But for now and for most of the time, you will not need that.

In this guide you will find a series of areas to learn and with each, a small set of commands. You dont need to memorise all this and the commands. I have kept the guide small enough so that you should find, after a few weeks and months, that the commands start to become part of your language.

Your goto things!

A mini toolbox.
