# Unix Command Line Toolbox
The steps below will take you from novice to getting a basic knowledge of the Unix OS and it's command line.

Even after 20+ years of using Unix I find this small set of commands the core of what is needed. Yes more is possible and there is, much much more. But for now, and for most of the time, you will not need all that extra stuff. More is always possible, people will always tell you how you need more! More dohnuts, more jeans, more stuff! But that can wait for tomorrow. Or never. ;-)

In this guide you will find a series of areas to learn and with each area, a small set of commands and some exercises to help learn those commands. You do not need to memorise all this and the associated commands. I have kept the guide small enough so that you should find, after a few weeks and months, that it all starts to become a bit of muscle memory. Or worst case, just come back to this guide.

Your goto commands!

A mini toolbox.

Start small and slowly expand. One area each day. Do not rush.


## Who am I and where is this?
```bash
whoami, pwd
```

So you arrive at your new machine and login and open a terminal. And you are presented with something like...
```bash
>
```
the first thing you will want to know is... ___Who am I???___ Well, fortunately unix has just the command for you...
``` bash
> whoami
```
it is very simple and returns a response of who is currently logged into the machine.

Next question is... __Where am I???__ Again unix has just the command for you...
``` bash
> pwd
```
otherwise known as _print working directory_. It returns a simple resonse of what directory you are currenty in. It is always good to know where you are. Especially if your memory is as short as mine.



## What can I see around me?
```bash
ls
```

## Am I allowed to travel?
```bash
cd, ~
```

## Can I create stuff?
```bash
mkdir, touch, vi
```

## And what if I dont like that stuff?

## Ive lost the stuff, how can I find it?

```

## What else is happening here?
```bash
