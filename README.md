# Unix Command Line Toolbox
The steps below will take you from novice to getting a basic knowledge of the Unix OS and it's command line.

Even after 20+ years of using Unix I find this small set of commands the core of whats needed. Yes more is possible and there is, much much more. But for now, and for most of the time, you will not need all that extra stuff.

In this guide you will find a series of areas to learn and with each, a small set of commands and exercises to learn those commands. You do not need to memorise all this and the associated commands. I have kept the guide small enough so that you should find, after a few weeks and months, that the it all starts to become part of your language.

Your goto commands!

A mini toolbox.
